**System theme settings not picked up on Linux**

On linux, PySide2 must be installed as system-wide package to access the currently selected theme settings.
A pip based installation falls back to Fusion theme, and won't pick up the run time changes in the theme settings.

Steps needed in order to use system theme settings on linux.

remove pip Pyside2 installation:
```
$ pip3 uninstall PySide2
```

also remove any system wide Pyside2 pip install
```
$ sudo pip3 uninstall PySide2
```

Qt5ct is not needed, so just ensure the current envrionment does NOT have the Qt5ct variable
```
$ env | grep QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME
```
The above command should show empty result.

Install PySide2 and dependent components as system wide package.

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pyside2.qtuitools python3-pyside2.qtwidgets libpyside2-py3-5.14
```

Ensure to use PySide2 api, in case there also exists a Qt5/Qt4 installation,
```
$ echo 'export QT_API=PySide2' >> ~/.bashrc 
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ python3 App.py
```
alternatively, one can run the app as:
```
$ QT_API=PySide2 python3 App.py
```

**Error on application launch - "No module named Crypto"**

The error may appear if 'crypto' package is installed on the system.
crpyto is deperecated and no longer recommended due to various security issues.  
Impartus application uses 'pycryptodome' that may conflict with 'crypto' package as they both provide the functions under 'Crypto' namespace.

To resolve the issue, uninstall crypto, then reinstall pycryptodome:
>
> $ pip3 uninstall crypto  
> $ pip3 uninstall pycryptodome  
> $ pip3 install pycryptodome  

---

**Error on application launch - "ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified procedure could not be found."**

On windows, this error may appear due to incompatibility between the PySide2 and python versions.
Upgrading to python version 3.7 or above should resolve the issue.

You may also need to upgrade your pip version, in case
pip3 list
output shows PySide2 version other than 5.15.2

$ pip3 install --upgrade pip

If you still see the issue, you may try upgrading python version, at present the following
python / windows version seem to have compatibility issues with PySide2 v5.15.2

Python v3.7.3, Windows 8.1    -   https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-1002

Python v3.9.0, Windows PE     -   https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/PYSIDE-1479
